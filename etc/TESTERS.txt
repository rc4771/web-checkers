1)Open command line and navigate to the project folder 
2)Enter "mvn compile exec:java" and wait for it to compile.
3)When it's finished, go to two different web browsers and type in "localhost:4567" as a URL in each. This simulates two players logging on.
4)When you get to the home page, click sign in, enter a username, and then when you'll be redirected to the home page. Once you've done this on both sessions, you'll
be able to see the "other player" on the home page. Click on the name to start a game.
